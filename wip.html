            <p style="margin: 20px;">Personality means the constitution of mental as well as the physical health of an individual. Personality may be defined as the characteristic pattern of behaviour that determines an individual’s adjustment to the environment or situation.</p>
            <p style="margin: 50px;"><b>Personality – Meaning</b><br>
              
              Personality has a long history. It dates from the time of Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 BC). In order to understand the behaviour of people in the organisational setting, we need to know the basic nature of personality. It is a psycho-social phenomenon, which analyses the cognitive features and presentation of individual in the society.
              <br>
              Personality is made up of the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviour of an individual. These attributes make a person unique. Personality originates within the individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life. Personality exhibits distinctive qualities of a person, especially those distinguishing personal characteristics that make one socially appealing. If a person wins an election on his own, society may say that he/she has won “more on personality than on capability”.
              <br>
              Personality reveals distinctive traits of mind and behaviour of a person. It is a pattern of collective character which includes behavioural, mental, temperamental, and emotional traits of a person that makes one socially appealing. It exhibits the quality of a person, which is visible and impresses or disturbs others. For example, the statements such as “He has a pleasing personality Raju is a Crude persona” reveal the collective characters of a person which exhibits positive or negative personality.</p>
